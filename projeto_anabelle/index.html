              "On the other hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
             men who are so beguiled and demoralized by the  charms  of pleasure  of 
             the moment, so blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and 
             trouble that are bound to ensue; and equal blame  belongs  to those who 
             fail in their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
             through shrinking from toil and pain. These  cases  are perfectly simple 
             and easy to distinguish. In a free  hour,  when  our power  of choice is 
             untrammelled and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
             best, every pleasure is to  be welcomed  and every  pain avoided. But in 
             certain circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
             of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated 
             and annoyances  accepted. The  wise man  therefore always  holds in these 
             matters to this  principle  of selection:  he rejects pleasures to secure 
             other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
