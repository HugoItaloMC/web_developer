        "On  the other  hand, we denounce with righteous indignation and dislike 
       men  who are so  beguiled and demoralized by the  charms  of pleasure  of 
       the  moment, so  blinded by desire, that they cannot foresee the pain and 
       trouble  that  are bound to ensue; and equal blame  belongs  to those who 
       fail in  their duty through weakness of will, which is the same as saying 
       through  shrinking from toil and pain. These  cases  are perfectly simple   
       and easy  to distinguish. In a free  hour,  when  our power  of choice is 
       untrammelled  and when nothing prevents our being able to do what we like 
       best,  every pleasure is to  be welcomed  and every  pain avoided. But in 
       certain  circumstances and owing to the claims of duty or the obligations 
       of business it will frequently occur that pleasures have to be repudiated 
       and annoyances  accepted. The  wise man  therefore always  holds in these 
       matters to this  principle  of selection:  he rejects pleasures to secure 
       other greater pleasures, or else he endures pains to avoid worse pains."
